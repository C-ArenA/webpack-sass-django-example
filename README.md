# Webpack + Django + SASS
I've been looking for a way to integrate these technologies, but I wasn't able to do so. This is why I'm uploading the files structure of the approach I have taken to solve this problem.

Of course, I'm not an expert in the field so it may be wrong, and you can (please do it) suggest me any changes.

I'm using node BTW, so you can use any library.

You will need to run the Django server with

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
and the webpack script to watch files
```bash
npm run watch
```
