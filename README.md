# Webpack + Django + SASS
I've been looking for a way to integrate these technologies, but I wasn't able to do so. This is why I'm uploading the files structure of the approach I have taken to solve this problem.

Of course, I'm not an expert in the field so it may be wrong, and you can (please do it) suggest me any changes.
